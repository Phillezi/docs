Welcome to the kthcloud administrator's handbook. Here you can find some
of the common tasks you will face as an admin, and what some possible
solutions are.

### Announcing news

To communicate with our users, kthcloud has a presence on Mastodon and
Bluesky. The Mastodon account is linked with the Discord server to relay
information to those users.

The outage reports are all AI generated with a fun and creative tone, so
try to keep any manual posts that way too\! A great way to keep the same
vibe is to send your post through ChatGPT or Llama 2.
