## Sign in with KTH

Please try logging in with KTH, as you would on any other KTH page. You
should be redirected to the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) setup page
automatically.

If this does not happen automatically, please complete the [step-by-step
guide](https://intra.kth.se/en/it/natverk/sakerhet/microsoft-365/sakra-ditt-kth-microsoft-365-konto-med-multifaktorautentisering-mfa-1.1154451)

### Already know what you're doing?
If you're already familiar with what MFA is and have an authenticator app on your phone, you can go directly to [KTH MFA setup](https://aka.ms/mfasetup)

### Need help?
If you need help with the MFA setup, please get in touch with KTH IT support. You can reach them at [it-support@kth.se](mailto:it-support@kth.se)
