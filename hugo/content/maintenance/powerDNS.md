title: PowerDNS Installation and Configuration
---

[PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/) is used to run a DNS server both in the Flemingsberg and Kista zones. The Flemingsberg  DNS server is configured as a separate machine (as against a VM). Please refer to the administrator guide [dnsEntry](../administration/dnsEntry.md "wikilink") for information on adding, removing and modifying DNS entries using the GUI server provided by PowerDNS.

This page outlines how to setup and configure PowerDNS for KTH Cloud.
